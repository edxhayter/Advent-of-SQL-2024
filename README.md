Welcome to my **Advent of SQL** repository! Here, you'll find my solutions for every challenge in Advent of Code, completed using SQL and related data manipulation techniques.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is organized into its own folder, containing:
- **Solution Files**: SQL scripts with the solution code.
- **README**: An accompanying file with the DDL that made the schema the challenge required along with the query and the output preview..

## Skills Developed

Throughout this journey, I honed several skills, including:

- **Parsing XML with XPath**: Efficiently navigating and extracting data from XML documents.
- **Manipulating JSON**: Handling and transforming JSON data formats for SQL-based solutions.
- **Using Arrays for Data Manipulation**: Leveraging SQL arrays for advanced data processing.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-sql.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific day's folder to explore its solution and documentation.
3. Review the README file in each folder for a deeper understanding of the challenge and approach.

## Reflections

Completing every day of Advent of Code was a rewarding journey. It provided an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into SQL and data manipulation techniques while tackling diverse and challenging problems. I plan to continue refining these skills and exploring more ways to apply SQL in problem-solving.
